            <h2>Why Hummingbirds are important?</h2>
            <p>Hummingbirds play an important role in the food web, pollinating a variety of fl owering plants, some of
                which are specifi cally adapted to pollination by hummingbirds. Some tropical hummingbirds are at risk,
                like other pollinators, due to habitat loss and changes in the distribution and abundance of nectar
                plants.</p>

                    <p>Hummingbird <span>eggs</span> are tiny and oval-shaped, approximately the size of a small pea. They range in
                        size from 0.5 to 0.8 inches (1.3-2 cm) long and weigh approximately 0.4 grams. The eggs have a
                        hard, smooth shell and are often white or white with a bluish or greenish tint. Most females lay
                        two eggs, which they incubate for 15 to 18 days.</p>

                        they get injured. Those that do survive can live 3-5 years.</p>

                <h2>Migration</h2>
                <p>It is believed that the first hummingbirds developed in South America after
                    arriving from Asia 22 million years ago. Once they spread through South America, a few species began
                    to
                    move to Central America, the Caribbean and eventually mainland North America. By migrating to areas
                    with
                    more abundant food, these little explorers had less competition for food and territory. Of course,
                    the
                    seasonal cooling also drove these species south every fall. This cycle of advancing and retreating
                    with
                    the seasons is the basic foundation of their migratory pattern.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-6">

                </div>
                <div class="col-6">
                    <h3>Tigger</h3>
                    <p>Although there are differing views in the birding community as to what triggers the start of
                        migration, it is generally thought that hummingbirds sense changes in daylight duration, and
                        changes in the abundance of flowers, nectar and insects. Instinct also plays a role in making
                        the decision to migrate.</p>
                    <h3>Making the Trip</h3>
                    <p>During migration, a hummingbird's heart beats up to 1,260 times a minute, and its wings flap 15
                        to 80 times a second. To support this high energy level, a hummingbird will typically gain
                        25-40% of their body weight before they start migration in order to make the long trek over
                        land, and water.</p>
                    <p>They fly alone, often on the same path they have flown earlier in their life, and fly low, just
                        above tree tops or water. Young hummingbirds must navigate without parental guidance.</p>
                    <p>Hummingbirds fly by day when nectar sources such as flowers are more abundant. Flying low allows
                        the birds to see, and stop at, food supplies along the way. They are also experts at using tail
                        winds to help reach their destination faster and by consuming less energy and body fat. Research
                        indicates a hummingbird can travel as much as 23 miles in one day. However those that make the
                        500 mile flight from Florida to the Yucatan do it in 18-22 hours non-stop, depending on wind
                        conditions.</p>

                    <h3>Ways to help</h3>
                    <p><span id="populations_bold_text">Plant native flowers</span>Hummingbirds
                        need nectar from flowers to survive. By planting native flowers in our gardens, we can provide
                        them with a reliable source of food. Native flowers are also more likely to attract hummingbirds
                        than non-native flowers.</p>
                    <p><span id="populations_bold_text">Create hummingbird feeders:</span> Hummingbird feeders can be a
                        great way to attract hummingbirds to our
                        yards, especially if there are not many native flowers in our area. However, it is important to
                        use the correct type of nectar and to clean the feeders regularly to prevent the spread of
                        disease.</p>
                    <p><span id="populations_bold_text">Support conservation organizations:</span> There are a number of
                        organizations that are working to
                        protect hummingbirds. By donating to these organizations, we can help them to continue their
                        important work.</p>
                    <p><span id="populations_bold_text">Educate others about hummingbirds:</span> By educating others
                        about the threats facing hummingbirds, we
                        can help to raise awareness and encourage people to take action to protect them.</p>
